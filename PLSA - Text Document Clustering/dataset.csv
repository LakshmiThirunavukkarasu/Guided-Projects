blood        money  they bought potter's field        bury stranger in fulfilled        spoken prophet jeremiah         and took thirty piece silver price        price set        son israel gave potter's        field lord directed me  prophecy utterly gross bastardisation old testament scripture  first matthew made mistake regarding name prophet  zechariah utters verse matthew make of         [zech -]  and weighed wage        thirty shekel silver  yhvh said me cast        treasury --the lordly price        paid them  took thirty shekel        silver cast treasury house        yhvh  first all verse zechariah deal betrayer messiah g'd  deal shepherd likely priest chosen serve function presiding people shortly g'd send judah israel conflict another  word treasury replaced king james scholar to potter precisely made matthew's quote fit better  but blatant error  correct translation hebrew indeed treasury also make perfect sense zechariah's context whereas potter's field totally unrelated  whether mistranslation intentional seems beyond speculation  however matthew's track record find hard resist notion intentional dishonesty       course matthew ample reason altering text  thirty piece silver match judas's situation christian seem be reader willing disregard contextual incongruity matthew might another prophecy toss around  however correct translation zechariah directly contradicts situation juda high priest  high priest put money treasury  worthless shepherd zechariah exactly opposite  course average thursday-night bible student prophecy presented matthew taken new testament face value  those matthew's work convincing enough  wine vinegar & casting lots:        then jesus led away crucified         [mt -]  they gave vinegar drink        mingled gall; tasted it        drink it  and crucified him        divided garment among casting lots:        might fulfilled spoken prophet         they parted garment among them upon        vesture cast lot  first all vinegar offered jesus actually common sour wine type roman soldier drank regularly  find right jesus dy soldier give drink --not polluted gall         [jn -]  jesus said i thirst  bowl        vinegar stood there put sponge full        vinegar hyssop held mouth         received vinegar said it finished;  but matthew seems drawing on passage prophet psalm         [ps -]  looked pity none;        comforter found none  gave        poison food lit put gall meat        thirst gave vinegar drink  add        punishment upon punishment may        acquittal thee  blotted        book living  course sour wine offered jesus done request drink  indeed seem show pity  psalm quoted david political military enemy  messiah jesus  surprising run problem see jesus psalm asks g'd damnation crucifiers whereas jesus gospel say         [lk ]  jesus said father forgive them        do  further matthew miss attempt create prophecy gall a bitter substance put jesus's drink meat psalm stipulates         prophecy vinegar faulty naturally ask what casting lot  brings nd psalm deserves discussion itself  suffice fact jesus's clothes divided told great thing  turn happened often felon day  soon see perhaps least erroneous passage psalm applied jesus  indeed bring interesting question quality jesus's clothes  man removed worldly possession ownership clothes worthy casting lot raise suspicion  nd psalm:        psalm attributed david lament condition attack enemy  becomes song praise yhvh hope  taken context part seem fit plight jesus crucifixion quite well  examine primary passage         verse -:  god god forsaken me         far helping me far word        groaning  oh god cry day        answer night find rest  jesus said cried first sentence cross  suggests whole psalm really jesus rather king david  course rest first stanza fit nicely jesus execution  jesus pictured complaining whole ordeal supposed like the lamb led mute shearer  indeed jesus much groaning even cross  certainly cry day night cross         -:  but worm man-- scorned men         see mock me  face wag        heads;  he committed cause yhvh         deliver him delight him  seems fit jesus's execution pretty well exception holy messiah called worm         -:  many bull encompass me open        mouth widely like ravening roaring lion         -:  yea dog round me company        evildoer encir-cle me pierced hand        foot  see bone divide        garment among them cast lost raiment         -:  you yhvh far away  deliver        soul sword life power        dog  save mouth lion        afflicted soul horn wild bull  seem quite convincing i'm sure early christian father wrote prophecy thought too  unfortunately prophecy fatal flaw  word have pierced really exist psalm  correct hebrew translation is         :  yea dog round me company        evildoer encircles me like lion        hand foot  hebrew phrase like lion rare verb form pierced differ phonetic character  hebrew text literally like lion ka'ari make sense context even fit animal imagery employed psalm writer  convenience urge christian change ka'aru   but add needed yet artificial weight prophecy christian translator chosen do  correct translation eliminate psalm referring jesus absence much honesty translator         apart erroneous verse  psalm lend jesus easily  verse  speaks sufferer saved sword rather cross  naturally fit psalm's true subject king david  side note crucifixion pierce hand palm rather forearm  much favour traditional thought resurrected jesus showing disciple scar palm  then fact bound religious belief
